# Chapter 12: Linear Programming
## 12.1 Introduction

Linear Programming (LP) is a branch of mathematics that deals with optimizing a linear objective function, subject to a set of linear constraints (inequalities or equations). It is one of the most practical mathematical tools used in diverse fields such as economics, business, engineering, and logistics to solve problems involving limited resources.

## Key Features of Linear Programming:

  1. Objective Function: A mathematical expression to be maximized or minimized, such as profit, cost, or time.
  2. Constraints: Limitations or restrictions expressed as linear inequalities or equations.
  3. on-Negative Restrictions: Variables must take non-negative values, as negative quantities are often not meaningful in real-world contexts.

## Applications of Linear Programming:

 - Optimization in manufacturing industries.
 -  Resource allocation in business and economics.
 -  Transportation and logistics for minimizing costs.
-  Agriculture for optimizing crop production.

## 12.2 Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation

A Linear Programming Problem (LPP) involves three main components:

-  Decision Variables: These represent the quantities to be determined.
-   Objective Function: A linear expression representing the goal (maximize or minimize).
-   Constraints: A set of linear inequalities or equations that restrict the values of the decision variables.

## Steps in Formulating an LPP

  - Identify the decision variables: Determine the unknown quantities to be optimized.
   - Define the objective function: Write a mathematical expression to represent the goal.
   - List the constraints: Write linear inequalities based on the given conditions.
   - Add non-negativity constraints: Ensure all variables are non-negative (x,y≥0x,y≥0).

## Example of LPP Formulation

Problem: A factory produces two products, A and B, with the following conditions:

  - Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 kg of raw material.
  -  Each unit of B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 kg of raw material.
  -  The factory has 120 hours of labor and 100 kg of raw material.
  -  Profit per unit of A is ₹40, and for B, it is ₹50.

## Formulation:

  1. Decision Variables: Let xx be the number of units of A, and yy be the number of units of B.
  2. Objective Function: Maximize profit Z=40x+50yZ=40x+50y.
  3. Constraints:
       - Labor constraint: 2x+3y≤1202x+3y≤120
       - Raw material constraint: 3x+2y≤1003x+2y≤100
 4. Non-Negativity Constraint: x≥0,y≥0x≥0,y≥0.

This problem can be solved graphically or algebraically to find the optimal values of xx and yy.

## 12.3 Different Types of Linear Programming Problems

Linear Programming Problems can be categorized into the following types based on their applications:
1. Manufacturing Problems

    These problems deal with the optimization of production.
    Objective: Maximize profit or minimize production costs.
    Example: Determining the number of products to be manufactured using limited resources like labor, raw materials, and machinery.

2. Diet Problems

    Used to find the optimal combination of food items that meet nutritional requirements at minimum cost.
    Objective: Minimize cost or maximize nutritional value.
    Example: A hospital diet plan that ensures specific amounts of proteins, vitamins, and calories within a limited budget.

3. Transportation Problems

    Concerned with minimizing the cost of transporting goods from multiple sources to various destinations.
    Objective: Minimize transportation costs while meeting supply and demand.
    Example: Transporting goods from factories to warehouses or retailers.

4. Assignment Problems

    Focus on assigning resources (like workers or machines) to tasks in an optimal manner.
    Objective: Minimize total time or cost of assignments.
    Example: Assigning workers to jobs based on their skills and availability.

5. Blending Problems

    Involve mixing resources in certain proportions to achieve desired outcomes.
    Objective: Minimize cost or maximize quality.
    Example: Creating an alloy by blending metals in specific ratios to meet quality standards.

## Graphical Solution of an LPP

Linear Programming Problems with two decision variables can be solved graphically using the following steps:

  - Represent the constraints as linear equations and plot them on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region (the intersection of all inequalities).
   - Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region.
   - Evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the optimal solution.

## Conclusion

Linear programming is a powerful mathematical tool for decision-making and optimization. Its ability to handle complex problems and constraints makes it indispensable in industries, research, and daily life. By understanding its principles and applications, students can gain valuable insights into real-world problem-solving.
